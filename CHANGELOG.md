# CHANGELOG

- 2026-08-30 (evening): END-OF-DAY SWEEP — trader.py --sweep-resting +
  morning.yml runs it when the buying day ends; closes the unfilled-
  resting-order hole (stale fills + phantom scoreboard rows). Audit
  also confirmed: window stays 9-11 AM (later hours show no edge and
  no in-band inventory), band stays 45-60c (review Sep 11), and all six
  checkable insufficient-balance orders would have won (funding note to
  owner).

- 2026-08-30: THE CITY BENCH — Oklahoma City (0W-7L) and Dallas (1W-9L)
  benched from real-money buys on scoreboard evidence; still scanned and
  logged on paper. scanner.py + index.html mirror, one commit. Review
  ~Sep 11 with the band trial.

- 2026-08-30: Added STATUS.md, DECISIONS.md, CHANGELOG.md (documentation
  only — no code or trading logic changed).
